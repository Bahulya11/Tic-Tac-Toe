# DICE GAME

_Developed a console-based dice game application using Java, aimed at enhancing understanding of basic programming constructs such as loops, conditional statements, and random number generation. The game allows users to roll a virtual dice and compete against the computer by comparing randomly generated dice values. This project provided hands-on experience with Java programming, object-oriented principles, and user interaction through the console. It also included error handling and simple game logic to determine the winner after each round._
